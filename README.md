# PathFinding_Visualizer_Using_Dijkstra_Algorithm
This pathfinding visualizer utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path between a source and a destination node. Users have the ability to customize paths by selecting the start and end nodes, as well as adding blocks or weights to nodes, thereby affecting the optimal path.
